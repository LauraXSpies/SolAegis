# Contributing to SolAegis

Thank you for your interest in contributing to SolAegis. We welcome engagement from students, researchers, developers, and organizations who are interested in climate-related health research and knowledge graph–based methods.

SolAegis is currently in an **early research and design phase**. Public contributions at this stage focus primarily on discussion, documentation, and conceptual feedback. Implementation code and active research pipelines are maintained in a separate controlled-access repository.


## Ways to Contribute

At the current stage, the following forms of contribution are particularly welcome:

- Reporting issues or inconsistencies in documentation
- Suggesting research directions, use cases, or methodological improvements
- Improving clarity, structure, or references in project documentation
- Participating in discussions around environmental data, knowledge graphs, and reproducible research

Contributions involving implementation code or experimental pipelines are reviewed on a case-by-case basis.

## Reporting Issues

If you notice an issue or have a question regarding the public project scope:

1. Please check existing issues to avoid duplicates.
2. Open a new issue with a clear title and detailed description.
3. Provide relevant context or references where possible.

## Suggesting Enhancements

We welcome thoughtful suggestions, especially those grounded in research or practical use cases.

When proposing an enhancement, please include:
- A short description of the idea
- The research or practical motivation
- Any relevant references or prior work

Please note that not all suggestions can be implemented, and acceptance depends on research scope, governance constraints, and available capacity.

## Code Contributions

At this stage, **direct code contributions to this public repository are limited**.

If you are interested in contributing code, experimental methods, or datasets as part of a research collaboration, please open an issue or contact the maintainers to discuss alignment, scope, and governance requirements before proceeding.

## Collaboration

We are open to collaboration with:
- Students (Bachelor’s, Master’s, PhD)
- Academic researchers
- Startups and early-stage ventures
- Public-sector, non-profit, and research-oriented organizations

Participation in research activities is subject to supervision capacity, project scope, and applicable institutional, ethical, and governance requirements, and does not constitute an automatic acceptance or partnership.

## Code of Conduct

All contributors are expected to engage respectfully and professionally.  
Harassment, discrimination, or inappropriate behavior will not be tolerated.
