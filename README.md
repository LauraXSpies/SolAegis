## About

This is a research proposal for using dynamic knowledge graphs (DKGs) to create actionable insights, interventions, and evaluations in relation to heat warning monitoring. Current climate projections in Europe suggest that, by 2100, the probability of heat events will more than double, potentially lasting 30% longer. This could lead to an increase in heat-related mortality, heat strokes, dehydration, and other health impacts[^1].

With the growing accessibility of multimodal healthcare data, connected health concepts can harness high-quality data to drive actionable, timely, and explainable measures. SolAegis aims to support resource allocation and personalized prevention measures in response to heat risks, ensuring interventions are both effective and tailored to individual health needs.
